When scheduling a meeting or study group session, it is very likely that some members of the group will not be available at a certain time or that the chosen location is not convenient for several members. As computer science students, we know exactly how this goes. That is why we came up with the idea of creating an app that could schedule meetings and study sessions efficiently.

Meet Me is an app that allows users to create and join groups and provide possible meeting times that fit within all member's schedules. Meetings can be added into the app and then tagged with a location. The app will provide reminders for all meetings that a user has agreed to. There is a group chat functionality and the app also allows impromptu meetings and location tagging to signal to other group members if they would like to join you.

The purpose of our app is to ease the process of scheduling meetings and study group sessions. Scheduling those through text can be really confusing and important messages can be lost in the group chat after several members reply to the person who created the group. Meet Me allows users to effectively schedule events by providing the necessary tools.
